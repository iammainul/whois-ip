# whois-ip

whois-ip is a simple whois tool in python for whois lookup for IP Addresses. It takes advantage of the python ipwhois package. This will only work with python3

The output is saved in a csv file named: "output.csv" 
The output currently only shows these following details:
- IP
- Name
- Country
- City
- Registrar
